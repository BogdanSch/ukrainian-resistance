Laboratory work 4 - Report

Version 1:
Create several blocks on the site. 
Make 3 rows: the first should have 2 blocks, the second - 6, and the third - two blocks occupy half of the screen and another 3 blocks on the remaining half. All blocks should transform depending on the screen size. 

When reducing to: 
-md- in the first row - 2 blocks of 4 columns,
-sm- in the second row - odd blocks disappear,
-xs- in the third row - an empty space appears instead of the 2nd block.
